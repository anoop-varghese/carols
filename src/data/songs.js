  `Silent night, holy night\nAll is calm, all is bright\nRound yon Virgin Mother and Child\nHoly infant so tender and mild`,
  `O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant\nO come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem\nCome and behold him, born the King of angels`,
  `Hark! the herald angels sing\nGlory to the newborn King\nPeace on earth and mercy mild\nGod and sinners reconciled`,
  `Joy to the world, the Lord is come\nLet earth receive her King\nLet every heart prepare Him room\nAnd heaven and nature sing`,
  `Away in a manger, no crib for a bed\nThe little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head\nThe stars in the sky looked down where He lay\nThe little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay`,
  `The first Noel, the angel did say\nWas to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay\nIn fields where they lay keeping their sheep\nOn a cold winter's night that was so deep`,
  `O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shining\nIt is the night of the dear Saviour's birth\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\nTill He appeared and the soul felt its worth`,
  `Angels we have heard on high\nSweetly singing o'er the plains\nAnd the mountains in reply\nEchoing their joyous strains`,
  `O little town of Bethlehem\nHow still we see thee lie\nAbove thy deep and dreamless sleep\nThe silent stars go by`
